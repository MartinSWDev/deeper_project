# Deeper Project #

This repo is a reproduction of my work carried out as part of the 11 week Deeper Lancs PHP Bootcamp

The original bootcamp work was created on Mac running all the PHP libraries / packages / server through Docker. This reproduction is built in a windows environment using XAMPP locally. Some of the data / environment available on the course is no longer available. My endeavour is to get this project back up and running then host it regardless of the missing data / envrionment.

## Initial Set Up ##

- Install XAMPP
  - https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
- Install Composer
  - https://getcomposer.org/download/
    - I used the Windows installer and installed globally
- Create Project in the 'htdocs' folder in 'xampp' folder

Depending on IDE and local environment there may be some additional configuration needed relating to PATHS. There are plenty of guides online to help get through these steps. I am currently using PHPStorm.

# Week 1 Session 2 #
Working on project

## Project ##
### Scenario ##
We have a new prospective client. Initech are an online supplier of this really cool thing. I remember you
saying you were really into it, so it felt like you’d be a good fit for the job. They want us to produce an app
for them which allows users to register and check-in to their products, leaving ratings and comments. If this
takes off, it could be big.

They’ve brought us the initial designs for how they’d like the product page to look. We need to demonstrate
our capabilities by putting together a demo page template for their products, with an interactive gallery.
Bonus points if you can make it responsive!
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little rough around the edges, as this is just a quick prototype.

### Tasks ###
- [x] Create the initial page
  - Create an HTML page which mirrors the design our designer has put together in desktop.png . You
    may use a static stars.png image for the star rating.
- [x] Stretch goal: Make the page responsive
  - The page should also be responsive - our designer has created a wireframe for this in mobile.png . The
    page should look the same on tablet devices as it does on mobile.
